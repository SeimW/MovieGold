# MovieGold
Movie review platform made with Java, React, JavaScript, and CSS.

You can look through movies, trailers, and add and view reviews that are saved to the database through MongoDB.

You will need to set up your own database with MongoDB in order to use this on your own machine.

This was developed through the use of this course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ

I have made small fixes throughout the source that allows this to work with JDK 23 and more recent React dependencies.
